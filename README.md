# ax25cmcl-howto

This is an archive of the **AX.25 Connected Mode Convergence Layer Howto** for the DTN2 
reference implementation of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group's 
Bundle Protocol.

The wiki at [dtnrg.org] has vanished!  I've created this git repo to store a 
snapshot of the last version of the wiki howto for this convergence layer.
It is stored in html and pdf formats.

[The dtnrg's home page is here](https://sites.google.com/site/dtnresgroup/home)

[Further info on the DTN2 code is here](https://sites.google.com/site/dtnresgroup/home/code)

[The DTN2 and oasys code can be found here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dtn/)
